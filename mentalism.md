Mentalism
---------

![ESP cards](../content/images/ESPcards144.gif)Mentalism is a branch of magic that appears to employ psychic powers to read someone's mind, predict the future, and similar paranormal action. But the mentalist is really a magician who uses conjuring methods to bring about such psychic effects. It's often been said that if a magician uses "sleight of hand," then a mentalist uses "sleight of mind." Therefore, although a mentalist's so-called psychic powers might appear to be genuine, he is really a highly skilled magician and entertainer.

The symbol cards at right are used in a cunning ESP experiment. Learn the secret of the cards in [The Deceivers](assembler.php?page=deceivers) and other secrets used by mentalists in [Shadow in the Mirror](assembler.php?page=shadow) and in Robert Aiello's latest thriller, [The Desperate Hours](assembler.php?page=home).
