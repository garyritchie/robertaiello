An uncompromising page-turner, SHADOW IN THE MIRROR revisits the intriguing world of magic and mentalism with Mr. Aiello's principled, engaging hero Grant Montgomery . . . Deft misdirection, clever sleight of pen and a heart-pounding flourish make this a compelling read that will keep you up well past midnight. Robert Aiello's talent is no illusion. I was hooked from the very first page."</em><br />Richard Montanari, bestselling author of THE VIOLET HOUR and KISS OF EVIL</dd><dd><em>". . . Robert Aiello spins a compelling yarn starring an attractive celebrity mentalist as the good guy and a luscious evil twin as the bad girl. Add in a sadistic gangster with an ice pick, several dashes of poison and a macabre buried clue, and you have a fine read in a classic mode. I can't wait to see the movie!"</em><br />Christine Andreae, bestselling author of SMOKE EATERS and GRIZZLY<br /></dd></dl><dl><dd><em>"You'll like SHADOW IN THE MIRROR, its suspense and complex plot. Grant Montgomery is a great character - empathetic, smart, and fun to read about. . ."</em><br />Barbara D'Amato, bestselling author of GOOD COP, BAD COP and past president, Mystery Writers of America<br /></dd></dl><dl><dd><em>". . . his second book featuring retired mentalist and entertainer Grant Montgomery is a solid followup to his debut (The Deceivers) . . . Aiello's plot is compelling."</em><br />Pittsburgh Tribune-Review<br /></dd></dl><dl><dd><em>"Aiello keeps things engrossing and moving at a fast pace . . . you'll find an interesting hero (in Grant Montgomery). . ."</em><br />Pittsburgh Post-Gazette<br /></dd></dl><dl><dd><em>"Robert Aiello takes a plot and characters that are very real and creates a story that keeps us in suspense. Just when I thought I had it figured out and began guessing what was going to happen next, he fooled me. . . Grant Montgomery is fast becoming one of my favorite fictional characters and I can see him right up there with Dirk Pitt . . . Needless to say, I can't wait for the next one."</em><br />Diane Morgan, Editor, New Book Reviews.com<br /></dd></dl><dl><dd><em>"Extremely evil antagonists provide plenty of suspense throughout the book. The killer is revealed half way through the story, which creates some intense moments . . . if you have not read Aiello's first book (THE DECEIVERS), don't despair. SHADOW IN THE MIRROR works well as a stand-alone. However, you may wind up craving the first book in the series anyway!"</em><br />The Romance Reader's Connection</dd></dl><dl><dd><em>"This is a fast-moving story; well-written with excellent characterizations; full of suspense and intrigue."</em><br />MyShelf.Com</dd></dl><dl><dd><em>". . . the book provides a very good read and some true suspense. . . real chills along the way. . . Shadow in the Mirror is an enjoyable nail-biter of a book. Rating: Very Good."</em><br />Curled Up with a Good Book<br /></dd></dl><h3>The Deceivers</h3><dl><dd><em>"The Deceivers is a strong suspense drama that never eases off the throttle until the climax is completed . . . Robert Aiello shows he has the right stuff to become a major player in the suspense genre."<br /></em> The Midwest Book Review<br /></dd></dl><dl><dd><em>". . . readers will find themselves thrilled with who gets their just deserts. . . for author Aiello has done justice to developing Montgomery and the rest of the cast of players in this first, and most interesting, tale of suspense."</em><br />ForeWord Magazine<br /></dd></dl><dl><dd><em>"In . . . this fast-paced suspense novel - the author's debut as a fiction writer - Aiello's succinct, page-turner style features cliff-hangar chapter conclusions . . . Grant Montgomery is destined for a long shelf life . . . Aiello wields words with power, and the descriptive narrative surrounding murders is unsettling."</em><br />Pittsburgh Tribune-Review<br /></dd></dl><dl><dd><em>"The story line is fast paced and exciting . . . Grant is a great character deserving of future starring roles . . ."</em><br />Harriet Klausner, top reviewer for Amazon.com<br /></dd></dl></div><!-- DONE: footer (from CEA) --><div id="footer"><ul id="footerlist"><li><a href="home"><span class="no">0...</span>home</a></li><li><a href="author"><span class="no">1...</span>author</a></li><li><a href="news"><span class="no">2...</span>news</a></li><li><a href="calendar"><span class="no">3...</span>calendar</a></li><li><a href="links"><span class="no">4...</span>links</a></li><li><a href="mentalism"><span class="no">5...</span>mentalism</a></li><li><a href="reviews"><span class="no">6...</span>reviews</a></li><li><a href="order"><span class="no">7...</span>order</a></li></ul><div style="float: right;">Site Design by <a title="Gary Ritchie, Designer + Digital Artist" href="http://garyritchie.com">Gary Ritchie, Designer + Digital Artist</a></div>&copy;2005, <a href="mailto:Bob@RobertAiello.com">Robert J.
