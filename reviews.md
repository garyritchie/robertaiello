-------------------------------

### The Desperate Hours

*"Bob Aiello keeps the suspense mounting as series hero, mentalist Grant Montgomery, comes out of retirement for one last performance. And Montgomery has to face not just an audience again, but an old nemesis who threatens the life of Montgomery's love. Or is this the most pressing danger for Colette? . . .Readers will have to plunge deeper into the book to find out. And they will very much want to. The writing is taut; the excitement is real. The author is on target."*
 G. Miki Hayden, author of the award winning Writing the Mystery

*"Robert Aiello's second novel of suspense is as sleek and mesmerizing a thriller as you are likely to read this year. An uncompromising page-turner, SHADOW IN THE MIRROR revisits the intriguing world of magic and mentalism with Mr. Aiello's principled, engaging hero Grant Montgomery . . . Deft misdirection, clever sleight of pen and a heart-pounding flourish make this a compelling read that will keep you up well past midnight. Robert Aiello's talent is no illusion. I was hooked from the very first page."*

 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

*"Robert Aiello takes a plot and characters that are very real and creates a story that keeps us in suspense. Just when I thought I had it figured out and began guessing what was going to happen next, he fooled me. . . Grant Montgomery is fast becoming one of my favorite fictional characters and I can see him right up there with Dirk Pitt . . . Needless to say, I can't wait for the next one."*
 Diane Morgan, Editor, New Book Reviews.com

*"Extremely evil antagonists provide plenty of suspense throughout the book. The killer is revealed half way through the story, which creates some intense moments . . . if you have not read Aiello's first book (THE DECEIVERS), don't despair. SHADOW IN THE MIRROR works well as a stand-alone. However, you may wind up craving the first book in the series anyway!"*

 ForeWord Magazine

*"In . . . this fast-paced suspense novel - the author's debut as a fiction writer - Aiello's succinct, page-turner style features cliff-hangar chapter conclusions . . .
